# Helping-you-with-Calculus-II-
This will be the solution to all of the problems in the math book "Calculus, 6th Edition
ISBN: 9780470888612 / 047088861X"
This solution is written in Python.

# What's next?
Create a website to provide the solutions for problems in the math book. However, students will take advantage of those solutions and avoid learning!
Therefore, this project needs a new direction.
